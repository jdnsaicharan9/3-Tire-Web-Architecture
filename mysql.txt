Install MySQL and start it using the following commands

sudo yum install -y https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql80-community-release-el7-3.noarch.rpm
sudo amazon-linux-extras install epel -y
sudo yum install -y mysql-community-server

sudo systemctl start mysqld 
sudo systemctl enable mysqld 
Get the password for the root user:

sudo grep 'temporary password' /var/log/mysqld.log
Login to MySQL:

mysql -u root -p
You have to change the root user's password before you can do anything, so run the following command to do that:

ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'MyNewPass1!';
upload the sql file

Create a new user called sam with the password MyNewPass1! that can access the database from localhost:

CREATE USER 'sam'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'MyNewPass1!';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON lotr.* TO 'sam'@'localhost';
